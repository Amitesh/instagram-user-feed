# Instagram User Stream

A sample app to get the user feed.

I assume you have installed ruby on your machine.

*) Run `bundle install`. It will install all required plugins (gems)
*) Run the application using `ruby stream.rb`

It will open the browser with the a sample user feed.


# Change of user

Open the `stream.rb` and change the `username` with a valid or existing user on Instagram. Then again run the application using `ruby stream.rb`
